BEL enhancement proposals will be developed and posted here for public consumption.  Any changes to the BEL Language or aspects highly pertinent to the BEL language such as BEL Nanopubs need to be proposed here. 

Please copy the template provided and fill out the relevant sections.  While the BEP is in Draft mode - please add it to the Draft directory. When it is approved, it will be moved to the Published directory.

If you have questions or need help updating a proposal, please add an issue to this project with your contact information.  Someone will contact you to help you write your proposal or edit a proposal.

Anyone can submit a BEP or propose edits to a BEP in DRAFT mode even if you are not the creator of the BEP.  The creator of the BEP will decide what edits to include.
