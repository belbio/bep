# PopulationAbundance function

## Abstract

The purpose of this BEP is to add populationAbundance(TAX:<species_id>) or pop(TAX:<species_id>) to the BEL Language. 

A populationAbundance function would allow biologists and toxicologists to capture population changes in species. There is currently no way to capture this information using BEL 2.0.0. This would be especially useful in microbiome work.

## Preamble

BEP-Id: BEP0001

Status: Draft

Version: 1

Authors: William Hayes (whayes@biodati.com)

Created-Date: 2018-04-23

Type: Standards Track

BEL-Version: 2.0.0+

## Rationale and Goals

Population abundance is not currently captured by the BEL Language. In order to support microbiome and environmental biologist, BEL needs the ability to describe effects on entire populations of organisms.

## Use Cases

Adding a populationAbundance() function would allow capturing population level changes due to environment or treatments. 

    # Penicillin decreases the population of Streptococcus entericus
    a(CHEBI:penicillin) decreases pop(TAX:1123302) 
  
    # Deer increases population of gray wolves
    pop(TAX:598490) increases pop(TAX:9612)
  
    # Firmicutes bacteria increases obesity
    pop(TAX:1239) increases path(MESH:Obesity)
  
## Specification

The new language feature is:

  populationAbundance(<Species>)
  pop(<Species>)
  
  Species is currently supported by the BEL.bio API using the NCBI Taxonomy (TAX) namespace.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposed feature is for 2.0.0+ and will be added to the language so does not require any efforts to migrate older BEL knowledge.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation will target the next minor point release of the BEL language after approval (e.g. 2.1.0) and will consist of adding the populationAbundance() function to the BEL Specification yaml file.
