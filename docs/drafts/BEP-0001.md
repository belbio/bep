# PopulationAbundance function

## Abstract

A populationAbundance function would allow biologists and toxicologists to capture population changes in species. There is currently no way to capture this information using BEL 2.0.0.


## Preamble

BEP-Id: BEP0001

Status: Draft

Version: 1

Authors: William Hayes (whayes@biodati.com)

Created-Date: 2018-04-23

Type: Standards Track

BEL-Version: 2.0.0


## Rationale and Goals

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Use Cases

Share how the new language feature will be used. For example, adding a populationAbundance() function would allow capturing population level changes due to environment or treatment. Consumers would be the EPA, Toxicologists, Microbiome biologists, etc.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new language feature.

## Backwards Compatibility

All BEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. BEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation must be completed before any BEP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of BEL Language and API details.
