# partOf Relationship

## Abstract

This BEP introduces the `partOf` relationship to the BEL language that mirrors the relationship by the same name in the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-relations/) and many other biomedical ontologies. 

This relationship replaces the `subProcessOf` relationship in the case of one biological process being a subprocess (part of) another biological process.
This relationship also replaces the `hasComponent` relationship that connects complexes to their members, noting that the relationship is the opposite direction.

## Preamble

BEP-Id: BEP-0010

Status: Draft

Version: 1

BEL-Version: 2.0.0+

Authors: Charles Tapley Hoyt (@cthoyt)

Created-Date: 2019-08-05

Type: Standards Track

## Rationale and Goals

The goal of introducing the `partOf` relationship is to allow more information to be stored in BEL for later reasoning in teh same way that it is stored in the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-relations/) and many other biomedical ontologies.

Similarly to GO, the `partOf` relation is used to represent part-whole relations.
Where GO necessitates that for `A partOf B` that all A's are part of a B, this is not always true in BEL, such as in the case that describes proteins participating in complexes.

This BEP also deprecates the usage of the ``subProcessOf`` relationship in favor of the usage of the ``partOf`` relationship between two biological processes. Similarly, this BEP deprecates the usage of the ``hasComponent`` relationship that connects proteins and other abundances to complexes and composites in favor of using the ``partOf`` relationship, keeping in mind that the relationship has the inverse meaning (``A hasComponent B`` is the same as ``B partOf A``). Such a change does not perclude downstream consumers of BEL from adding the reciporacal relationships for algorithms such as graph traversals.

### Reasoning over *part of*

Basically, any direct paths containing only `partOf` and `isA` imply `partOf`.

#### `A partOf B` and `B isA C` implies `A partOf C`

For proteins, this would describe a hierarchy of complexes. 

```
p(X) partOf complex(Y)
complex(Y) isA complex(Z)

# Infer:
p(X) partOf complex(Z)
```

#### `A partOf B` and `B partOf C` implies `A partOf C`

For proteins, this would describe a complex formed of other complexes.

```
p(X) partOf complex(Y)
complex(Y) partOf complex(Z)

# Infer:
p(X) partOf complex(Z)
```

#### `A isA B` and `B partOf C` implies `A partOf C`
```
p(HGNC:PRKAA1) isA p(FPLX:AMPK_alpha)
p(HGNC:PRKAA2) isA p(FPLX:AMPK_alpha)
p(FPLX:AMPK_alpha) partOf p(FPLX:AMPK)

# Infer:
p(HGNC:PRKAA1) partOf p(FPLX:AMPK)
p(HGNC:PRKAA2) partOf p(FPLX:AMPK)
````

## Use Cases

### `partOf` as a drop-in replacement for `subProcessOf`

A biological process is a subprocess of another (note these examples use OBO-style syntax from BEP-0008)

```
bp(GO:0006915 ! "apoptotic process") partOf bp(GO:0012501 ! "programmed cell death")
````

### `partOf` as an inverse replacement of `hasComponent`

In BEL 1.0/2.0, the definition of the 911 complex would have been written with:

```
complex(FPLX:9_1_1) hasComponent p(HGNC:HUS1)
complex(FPLX:9_1_1) hasComponent p(HGNC:RAD1)
complex(FPLX:9_1_1) hasComponent p(HGNC:RAD9A)
```

To unify the relationships with FamPlex itself, it can now be written as:

```
p(HGNC:HUS1)  partOf complex(FPLX:9_1_1)
p(HGNC:RAD1)  partOf complex(FPLX:9_1_1)
p(HGNC:RAD9A) partOf complex(FPLX:9_1_1) 
```

### `partOf` in annotation of protein domains

The existence of a domain within a protein can be described like in the following:

```
p(INTERPRO:"Death domain") partOf p(HGNC:DAPK1)
```

The hierarchy of protein domains can be described like in the following:

```
p(INTERPRO:"DAPIN domain") partOf p(INTERPRO:"NACHT-associated domain")
```

## Discussion


- @whayes I'm thinking I'd like to remove the computed edges from the Specification and instead add that as a guidance on approaches for dealing with computed edges. I'm currently re-working computed edges in BELbio and all of the computed relations start with has* I'm trying to reduce expansion of edges in the graph database by not putting in both directions for every reversible edge - not sure if that is a strategy that will survive long term.
- @ncatlett I don't think we need to include both directions for a relationship/edge in the BEL language, but it is needed for graph traversal. I don't have a strong opinion for which direction we include in the language specification, only a preference for consistency.


## Specification

The equivalence relation will be used as any other predicate, where any BEL term can be used as the subject and object.

`<BEL term 1> partOf <BEL term 2>`
	
This relationship is not two ways.

## Backwards Compatibility

This BEP is backwards compatible. Compilers for BEL 1.0, 2.0, and 2.1 can automatically upgrade statements that are deprecated without the inclusion of additional information.
